NAME: Aahana Hegde

Roll No.: Me21b001

Previous experience: Python and basic C++

Current PORs: None :(

Why i want to work in the team: Making a box of metal think on its own is super cool and i want to help with working on cool stuff like this. I'm interested in learning programming more deeply and working on projects will help get a more intuitive grasp on software. 

Relevant courses:

none yet in software, but we have CS1100 for trim 3

mechanical: me1480

Other relevant things:
What I've learned from the apps is that software projects take a lot of patience, there were a lot of mishaps on the way (i almost wiped my C drive trying to salvage the data from a crashed VM), but i really enjoyed working on new things.

Did i attempt the bonus questions?:
2.yes

My attempts:
OpenCV:Using blob detection libraries was my first choice, since masking also detects road lines,but every time i ran a blob detector i kept getting a segmentation error,('Segmentation fault (core dumped)' in particular). Also i tried a more complex masking method that almost wiped out everything except the white potholes, my idea was so save this as a video (i.e "masked.avi") then use a contour based object detector on this new video, but for somre reason i couldnt get it to work)
